## Issues Fixed - Round 2

### ‚úÖ Background Music Timing Issue

**Problem:** Music was trying to start before user interaction, causing browser autoplay policy violations.

**Error Message:**
```
Could not play background music NotAllowedError: play() failed 
because the user didn't interact with the document first.
```

**Root Cause:**
- `BackgroundMusicManager` was trying to auto-start music
- Browser requires user interaction before playing audio
- Music should only start when user clicks "Continue" on ConsentPage

**Solution Applied:**

1. **Updated `ConsentPage.js`**
   - Music now starts when user clicks "Continue" button
   - This is a valid user interaction for browser autoplay policies
   - Added `useBackgroundMusic` hook directly to the page

2. **Updated `BackgroundMusicManager.js`**
   - No longer tries to auto-start music
   - Only maintains playback state during navigation
   - Silently fails if music isn't ready (graceful degradation)

3. **Enhanced `useBackgroundMusic.js` hook**
   - Checks `audioRef.current.paused` property to prevent duplicate play attempts
   - Adds event listeners for 'play' and 'pause' to track actual state
   - Properly handles already-playing audio
   - Re-throws errors so caller knows when play fails

**New Flow:**
```
User visits app
    ‚Üì
ConsentPage loads
    ‚Üì
User checks all boxes
    ‚Üì
User clicks "Continue" ‚Üê Music starts here!
    ‚Üì
Navigate to StartScreen
    ‚Üì
Music continues playing
```

## Code Changes

### 1. ConsentPage.js
```javascript
// Added import
import { useBackgroundMusic } from '../../hooks/useBackgroundMusic';

// Updated handleConfirm
const handleConfirm = async () => {
  if (allAgreed) {
    giveConsent();
    
    // Start background music on user interaction
    try {
      await play();
      console.log('üéµ Background music started');
    } catch (e) {
      console.warn('Could not start background music:', e);
    }
    
    navigate('/start');
  }
};
```

### 2. BackgroundMusicManager.js
```javascript
// Simplified to only maintain playback, not start it
useEffect(() => {
  if (gameState.consentGiven) {
    play().catch(() => {
      // Silently fail - music may already be playing
    });
  }
}, [gameState.consentGiven, play]);
```

### 3. useBackgroundMusic.js
```javascript
// Check if already playing before attempting
const play = async () => {
  if (!audioRef.current) return;
  
  if (!audioRef.current.paused) {
    return; // Already playing
  }
  
  try {
    await audioRef.current.play();
    isPlayingRef.current = true;
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn('Could not play background music:', e);
    throw e; // Re-throw for caller
  }
};
```
