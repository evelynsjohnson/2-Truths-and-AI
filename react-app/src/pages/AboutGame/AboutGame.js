            <p>
              Riccardo suggested an idea for the game, asking us if we've ever played "2 Truths and a Lie",
              saying that he had noticed that after a few rounds it's tough to come up with believable
              lies, and that we could use AI to help with that. So we decided to expand on it. Eventually
              Evelyn renamed it "2 Truths and AI?" as a clever play on words from the original game.

              Our process is centered on a core gameplay loop: players submit truths, our system sends them to
              a free AI API (gpt-35-turbo, gpt-5-nano, and gpt-4.1-mini) to generate a convincing lie, and
              then having players vote to identify which statement is the AI.

              We follow design principles like providing clear feedback (e.g., loading screens, animations,
              tooltips), using unambiguous signifiers (like unique player symbols for voting), and relying on both knowledge
              in the world and in the head to make the game intuitive and engaging for everyone.
